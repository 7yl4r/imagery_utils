DESCRIPTION
-----------

The pgc_mosaic_parallel utility submits mosaic jobs to HPC cluster.  This script invokes pgc_mosaic_build_tile.py and pgc_mosaic_build_cutlines.py for process execution for each job.

src:
	text file or directory of input rasters.  Only tif images are considered for inclusion.
	
mosaicname:
	output mosaic name excluding extension

-h, --help:
	show this help message and exit
	
-r RESOLUTION RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION RESOLUTION:
	output pixel resolution -- xres yres (default is same as first input file)
	
-e EXTENT EXTENT EXTENT EXTENT, --extent EXTENT EXTENT EXTENT EXTENT:
	extent of output mosaic -- xmin xmax ymin ymax (default is union of all inputs)
	
-t TILESIZE TILESIZE, --tilesize TILESIZE TILESIZE:
	tile size in coordinate system units -- xsize ysize (default is 40,000 times output resolution)
	
--force_pan_to_multi:
	if output is multiband, force script to also use 1 band images
	
-b BANDS, --bands BANDS:
	number of output bands( default is number of bands in the first image)
	
--tday TDAY:
	month and day of the year to use as target for image suitability ranking (e.g. 04-05)

--nosort:
	do not sort images by metadata. script uses the order of the input text file or directory.  Fist image is the first drawn and subsequent images will overlay the earlier images. Not recommended if src is a directory; the sort order will be random.
	
--use_exposure:
	use exposure settings in metadata to inform score.  This is applicable usually only in Antarctica.
	
--exclude EXCLUDE:
	file of SCENE_IDs to exclude
	
--mode {ALL,MOSAIC,SHP,TEST}:
	mode: ALL- all steps (default), SHP- create shapefiles, MOSAIC- create tiled tifs, TEST- create log only
	
--log LOG:
	file to log progress (default is <output_dir>\mosaic.log
	
--qsubscript QSUBSCRIPT:
	qsub script to use in cluster job submission (default is <script_dir>/qsub_mosaic.sh)
	
-l L:
	PBS resources requested (mimics qsub syntax)
	
--component_shp:
	create shp of all component images as well as cutline shp
	
--gtiff_compression {jpeg95,lzw}:
	GTiff compression type (default=lzw). JPEG95 is jpeg compression at 95%.

	
MOSAIC SCORING ALGORITHM
------------------------
Image Score

The mosaic tools scoring algorithm uses image metadata information sot score each images based on its suitability.  Each variable is normalized to a value between 0 and 1 and multiplied by a weighting factor relative to it’s importance.  Images with cloud cover > 50% are automatically excluded.

Variables used are:
1. Cloud cover - lower is preferred
2. Sun elevation - higher is preferred
3. Off nadir agnle - lower is preferred
4. Distance from target day of the year - smaller is preferred

If a target day of year is specified: 
Score = 30 * (1 - CloudCoverPercent) + 10 * (SunElev/90) + 5 * (90 - OffNadirAngle)/90.0 + 55 * (183 -DistanceFromTargetDatOfYearf)/183.0

Otherwise:
Score = 48 * (1 - CloudCoverPercent) + 28 * (SunElev/90) + 24 * (90 - OffNadirAngle)/90.0

Exposure Threshold

The user has the option to exclude images with high exposure settings (--use-exposure option).  This is useful in Antarctica where the high albedo can render images useless.  Overexposure is defined as: TDI / Sun Elev > Sensor-band threshold

For panchromatic images, the pan TDI is used.  For multispectral images, the green band TDI is used.  Sensor-band threshold values were derived empirically:

Sensor		Band	Threshold Value
WorldView-1	Pan	1400
WorldView-2	Pan	1400
WorldView-2	Green	400
WorldView-3	Pan	1400
WorldView-3	Green	400
Quickbird	Pan	500
Quickbird	Green	25
Geoeye-1	Pan	None
Geoeye-1	Green	170
